<h1>Curious student, professional software and web developer, entrepreneur, activist and fast learner.</h1>

<p><b>Passionate about the places hardware and software combine, space exploration, using technology to make a difference, and “making” in almost any form (ask me about my quest to perfect the perfect Buffalo wing sauce). I seek interesting problems & love that feeling I get when something I made starts working the way it’s intended to.</b></p>
